# Apple-vs-FBI

I got tired hunting around for all the documents in the Apple-v-FBI case, so I decided to collect them
all and put them GitHub. Then I found that JustSecurity had already done something like this
here https://www.justsecurity.org/29634/readers-guide-magistrate-judge-writs-act-cases/.

Anyway, if there's some other doc you want in the collection, then create a pull request and contact
me on Twitter @ErrataRob to tell me to accept the pull request.
